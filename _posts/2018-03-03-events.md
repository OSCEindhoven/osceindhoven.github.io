# Events

We are very excited to announce the OSC/e's first campus-wide event:

## Multi-disciplinary Data and Code Sharing Discussion

On Thursday, 28 February, experts from various fields/departments at TU/e will talk about the data they collect as part of their research, how they process it with software, how they share the data and code internally and externally, and the challenges they encounter during this process. 

More details about the event, including speaker info, can be found below. **<a href="#register">Register now</a>** to join the discussion! Spaces are limited!

**Location: Corona Hall, Luna Building**

**Date: Thursday, 28 february 2019.**

**Time: 12h00 - 18h00** (includes time for lunch, before, and drinks, after)

**Program:**

We'll start with some lunch snacks and then head into the Corona Hall for the discussion. After a short introduction, the speakers will share their experience of data and code sharing. Discussion is encouraged throughout, as this forum is not about attending lectures but rather to learn from each other in an interactive setting. We'll break for coffee/tee in the middle, and then carry on with the program until 17h00. After this we'll move to the Hubble for some drinks to round off the day and celebrate the first official campus-wide event of the OSC/e. **Snacks and coffee/tee are provided as part of the event.**
