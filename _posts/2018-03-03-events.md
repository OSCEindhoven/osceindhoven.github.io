<br><center style="font-size: 17px"> We are very excited to have hosted OSC/e's first campus-wide event</center><br>

## Multi-disciplinary Data and Code Sharing Discussion

On Thursday, 28 February, experts from various fields/departments at TU/e talked about the data they collect as part of their research, how they process it with software, how they share the data and code internally and externally, and the challenges they encounter during this process. 

More details about the event, including speaker info, and links to slides can be found below.

**Location: Corona Hall, Luna Building**

**Date: Thursday, 28 february 2019.**

**Time: 12h00 - 18h00**

**Program:**

We'll start with some lunch snacks and then head into the Corona Hall for the discussion. After a short introduction, the speakers will share their experience of data and code sharing. Discussion is encouraged throughout, as this forum is not about attending lectures but rather to learn from each other in an interactive setting. We'll break for coffee/tea in the middle, and then carry on with the program until 17h00. After this we'll move to the Hubble for some drinks to round off the day and celebrate the first official campus-wide event of the OSC/e. **Snacks and coffee/tea are provided as part of the event.**
